# **Real-Time Price Prediction for Precious Metals and Crude Oil HYBRID Model - 99% Accuracy**

## **Overview**
This repository contains a system for predicting the prices of precious metals (gold and silver) and crude oil using hybrid machine learning models. The project consists of two components:

1. **Training the Models**: Historical data is used to train predictive models, which are then saved for future use.
2. **Real-Time Prediction**: A real-time system that loads the pre-trained models and applies them to live data for price predictions.

The project is implemented in Python and requires Jupyter Notebook for training and prediction workflows.
